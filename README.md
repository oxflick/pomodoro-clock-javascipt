<h1>JavaScript Pomodoro Clock </h1>

<p> In this project you will find a JavaScipt Pomodoro clock. You can set up the time for something you're working on, and the break in between. As soon as your time finishes, it will signal you that you need to take a break. The clock will continiue to run with the break duration. </p>

<p> This project is written with vanilla JavaScript. I used setTimout and clearTimout to control the timer. </p>

<ul> There are three user stories covered.
	<li> User can start a 25 minute pomodoro, and the timer will go off once 25 minutes has elapsed.</li>
	<li> User can reset the clock for my next pomodoro.</li>
	<li> User can customize the length of each pomodoro.</li>
</ul>
